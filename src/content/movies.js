    review: `_Le Bonheur_ is a colorful French film directed by Agnès Varda in 1975. 
              The story follows François, a carpenter, and his seamstress wife Thérèse, 
              who are happily in love and have two children. However, while working on a 
              job in the city, François meets another woman who he falls for immediately. 
              Beneath its overwhelmingly radiant aesthetic, the film masks themes of infidelity and patriarchy.

              Between the outfits of our characters, the landscapes, and the solid color cuts 
              placed between scenes, we are spoiled in each shot with beautiful stills and rich tones. 
              Apart from the visuals, it is clear that Varda uses these colors to represent François 
              and his version of “happiness.” We as viewers expect to see a diminished state of color 
              throughout his acts of selfishness, but instead see that his happiness remains through 
              and through, telling of his character and the message Varda is portraying through him. 

              Although I found the plot to be flat overall, Varda’s capability of showing the power 
              struggle between Francois and Therese, and the opposing consequences for both characters 
              visually is where the film succeeds most. Its an impressive watch that keeps your eyes glued 
              to the screen to catch every shade of color being displayed. I enjoyed it and look forward to 
              exploring more of Varda’s work in the future.`,
